- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] No linting errors (`npm run lint`)
- [ ] Code review completed

### ✅ Environment Configuration

- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Production API endpoints updated
- [ ] Database connections configured (if applicable)
- [ ] External service API keys set

### ✅ Security

- [ ] Environment variables for sensitive data
- [ ] HTTPS enabled in production
- [ ] CORS configured appropriately
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented (if needed)
- [ ] Input validation on all endpoints

### ✅ Performance

- [ ] Images optimized
- [ ] Fonts optimized
- [ ] Bundle size acceptable
- [ ] Static generation configured

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Vercel Deployment (Recommended)

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel

# Follow prompts to configure:
# - Project name: alx-polly
# - Directory: ./
# - Override settings: No
```

### 2. Manual Deployment

```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start

# Set environment variables in your hosting platform
```

### 3. Environment Variables for Production

```env
NODE_ENV=production
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME=ALX Polly
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_VERSION=1.0.0
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-domain.com
```

## Post-Deployment Verification

### ✅ Functionality Tests

- [ ] Home page loads correctly
- [ ] Health check endpoint responds (`/api/health`)
- [ ] All links work properly
- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile

### ✅ Performance Tests

- [ ] Page load times acceptable
- [ ] API response times good
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Lighthouse score > 90

### ✅ Security Tests

- [ ] HTTPS redirects work
- [ ] No sensitive data exposed
- [ ] External links have proper attributes
- [ ] API endpoints secured

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Health Checks

- Set up monitoring for `/api/health` endpoint
- Configure uptime monitoring
- Set up error tracking (Sentry, etc.)

### Logging

- Configure application logging
- Set up error logging
- Monitor performance metrics

### Updates

- Keep dependencies updated
- Monitor security advisories
- Regular backups (if applicable)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build fails**: Check Node.js version compatibility
2. **Environment variables not working**: Verify naming convention
3. **API endpoints not responding**: Check CORS configuration
4. **Performance issues**: Optimize images and bundle size

### Support

- Check Next.js documentation
- Review deployment logs
- Test locally before deploying
